Gray is a graphical ComputerCraft OS featuring advanced windowing and networking, built-in developer tools, full CraftOS compatibility, and much more.

# Building
Gray uses [make](https://github.com/jv110/make) v2.1 for building.
The framework builds to a library file at system/lib/gray.dl, and the OS builds to system/sys.
